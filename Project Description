Coronavirus Tweet Sentiment Analysis

Classification

Project Description

Business Context

This challenge asks you to build a classification model to predict the sentiment of COVID-19 tweets.The tweets have been pulled from Twitter and manual tagging has been done then. The names and usernames have been given codes to avoid any privacy concerns.

Dataset Description
| Fields               | Description                |
|----------------------|----------------------------|
| Username             | Coded Username             |
| ScreenName           | Coded ScreenName           |
| Location             | Region of origin           |
| TweetAt              | Tweet Timing               |
| OriginalTweet        | First tweet in the thread  |
| Sentiment-Target variable | Sentiment of the tweet  |




Main Libraries used:

Pandas for data manipulation, aggregation
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization and behavior with respect to the target variable
NumPy for computationally efficient operations
Scikit Learn for model training, model optimization, and metrics calculation
Project Architecture:

## Sentiment Analysis Workflow

### EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- **Distribution of tweets across location**
  - Come up with more ideas
- **Word Cloud of different tweets**
- **Is tweet sentiment correlated to tweet timing?**
- **Visualizing and analyzing relationships**
  - Forming assumptions and obtaining insights
  - Are negative tweets concentrated in a particular location?
  - Come up with more ideas

### Clean-up
- **Understanding business problem**
- **Missing Values**
- **Outliers**

### Feature Engineering
- **Feature Encoding**
- **Creating new features if required**
- **Removing Multicollinearity**

### Pre Processing
- **Feature Scaling** - std scaler/min-max scaler
- **Handling imbalance if any**

### Model Implementation
- **Train Test Split**
- **Which algorithm to use? What's your reasoning?**
- **Training**
- **Testing**
- **Hyper parameter tuning**
- **Evaluation** - Keep in mind the class imbalance if any

### Model Explainability
- **Feature Importance and Conclusion**
